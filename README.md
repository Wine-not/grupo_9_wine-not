## 📑 References:

1. <p><a href="http://www.mosquitamuertawines.com" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Mosquita Muerta Wines</a></p> We chose this website  as  reference because of how organized the products are displayed.  This website uses  a neat  and simple interface, we love  the fact they are using only two colours. As we heard it before,  a little goes a long way, or sometimes less is more...

2. <p><a href="https://www.vivino.com/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Vivino</a></p>  This is another of the sites we selected as part of our inspiration. It is easy to use and does not have too much visual load. Because of this, their products can be found quickly, giving no trouble  at all. It should also be noted that each product offers a brief but detailed information sheet with information, including star ratings and comments.  This is also key as other client's opinions on the products could impact future sells.

3. <p><a href="https://www.seedlipdrinks.com/en-gb/shop/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Seedlip</a></p> The design is simply amazing. The page shows well balanced colours, fine lines, low saturation (which we believe is very important because our user may be staring at the screen for a while as he or she selects the product). It also contains a lot of fluidity and animated transitions which gives a pleasant feeling to navigate through the different areas.

4. <p><a href="https://buywine.cl/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Buywine</a></p> We have taken inspiration from this website, because it has a good user-friendly design, and it also  offers a good composition of images. It has a minimalist design, but intuitive for users. We are all about white backgrounds. It has filters, if you know what you are looking for, great, if not they help you out. Client can choose from different colours of wine to different taste.

5. <p><a href="https://vinporter.com" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Vinporter</a></p>  This page caught our attention because it looks clean and neat, this  allows the user to use it intuitively. The photos are quite striking but not overwhelming, who wants to get overwhelmed when choosing their favorite wine?

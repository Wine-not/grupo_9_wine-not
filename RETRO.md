<h1>🔁 Feedback Sprint 1</h1> 

<h3>¿What did we do right?</h3>
We worked as a team and were able to meet the deadline on time.
The final result was the one we expected and communication wise, everything went well.
<br/>
<h3>¿How did we feel about it?</h3>
It was very challenging, some of us felt overwhelmed but had the chance within the project to improve and learn from the mistakes and delays.
Each team member had the opportunity to face their own weaknesses and work on improving them.
<br/>
<h3>¿What can we improve?</h3>
We would say that delegating tasks is one of the most important steps we have to work on.
One of the strategies we want to implement would be a daily meeting (at least 15-20 minutes ) so we can listen to each other and supervise our personal tasks so that throughout the whole process we can put them together and complete the project as a team. This is also really good when it comes to helping the teams if they find trouble or issues that haven't had a solution.
As of right now we already have our Sprint finished. That means that now we have evidence and understand how the group handled the whole situation and the project itself.
<br/>
<h3>💡 Let's now think this through :</h3>
<ul>Where to begin (What should we start doing).
<li>-Daily meetings (15-20 mins)</li>
<li>-Organize Trello and delegate tasks keeping in mind our team member's strengths and weakness
Do more.</li>
<li>-Acquire more responsibility on individual tasks.</li>
<li>-Daily meetings.</li>
</ul>
<ul>Keep doing it.
<li>-Keep the work alive and not giving up. Discipline as our number one skill.</li>
</ul>
<ul>Do less.
<li>-Stop putting more work and overwhelming tasks on some of the team members.</li>
</ul>
<ul>Stop doing it.
<li>-Not communicating well enough and being absent for too long, team works requires effort but also time.</li>
</ul>

<h1>🔁 Feedback Sprint 1</h1> 

<h3>¿What did we do right?</h3>
We had to merge our projets, as we were put into a new group. We communicated properly, and all of us were very flexible regarding this change as we knew it was for the best. 
<br/>
<h3>¿How did we feel about it?</h3>
We all agree it has not been easy but we have done the best we could and its been a smooth transition. Each and every single one of us has something to add to the group and the project itself. Little by little we have gathered our knowledge and efforts and we have made it possible to complete each stage. This is something that makes us truly proud of our time management ad communication skills.  
<br/>
<h3>¿What can we improve?</h3>
There is always room for improvement. We have worked well with Trello and we have meetings very often. That is something that we have improved but could be better.
